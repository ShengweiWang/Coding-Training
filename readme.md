_371_SumOfTwoIntegers
_260_SingleNumberIII:
    care about the negative integer. Use diff &= -diff to get the rightmost different bit

_287_
    double cycle linked list
_309_
_326_ (as long as the range is known, there is a tricky way to solve problem)
_44_ should use dp

240 o(m+n)
73 O(1)
341 use list iterator

380 : switch to keep index

Debugging Hints
_167_TwoSumII_InputArrayIsSorted
    binary search
    shift precedence is lower than + : mid = l + ((r - l) >>1);
_238_
    int[] b = a.clone(); it will clone the content in the array. not suitable for high dimension, because in high dimension, each array will store a pointer
_347_
    List<Integer>[] bucket = new List[123];
    res.addAll(bucket[i]);

_217_
    set.add will avoid duplicate. And set.contains() will take a lot of time

_94_
    usually, even the result is empty, we should return an empty result rather than null

_216_
    dizzy, basic dfs

208 trie

188 need to consider some accelerate case

56 : Collections.sort(), Comparator 
257 : java reference StringBuilder

291 : startWith, substring, containsKey, contains, add, put

Need optimization:

BIT binary indexed tree


LinkedList:
1.two pointer, slow, fast to caculate the enter of cycle, and count the mid, (slow, fast <-head, 
    when fast == null || fast.next == null, slow == mid (odd mid, even start of right)
2.Use dummy.next = head to avoid corner case
3.A nice way to get intersection. a = a == null?headB:a.next; 
4.Copy random a1->b1->a2->b2...
5.Insertion Sort

HashMap:
1.hashset, hashmap
2.double mapping

TwoPointer:
1.Slow and fast pointer
2.X sum problem, sorted, then go l, r
3.int[n + 1] stores 1~n , must have a circle
4.
